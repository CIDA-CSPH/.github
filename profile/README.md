## How to organize project repositories (PRs)

- Each PR should be nested in Teams [and prefixed by the team name or abbreviation?]
- Each PR should have all subdirectories one would expect for a project: Admin, Background, Code, DataProcessed, DataRaw, Dissemination, and Reports
- Each PR should have a readme.md file
- Each PR should have a .gitignore file which tells Git not to track data and other large binary files
